# 365-Discipline

A one-page, no-comfort 365-day checker built for **discipline, not motivation**.

This is not a habit tracker.  
It does not remind you.  
It does not encourage you.  
It only records the truth.

---

## What This Is
- A **single-screen 365-box grid**
- Each box represents **one real calendar day**
- You either show up — or you don’t

Empty boxes stay visible forever.

---

## Core Rules
- You can mark **only today**
- Past days are locked
- Future days are inaccessible
- Missing a day resets the **streak to zero**
- Progress is saved **only when you click SAVE**

No auto-save. No forgiveness window.

---

## Undo Policy (Fair, Not Soft)
- Undo is allowed **only before SAVE**
- After SAVE → permanent
- This protects against misclicks, not indecision

---

## Data Storage
- Uses `localStorage`
- No login
- No backend
- If browser data is cleared, the year is erased

This is intentional.

---

## Streak Logic
> Streak = number of consecutive completed days ending today.

Skip today → streak = 0  
Miss any day → streak resets immediately

---

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Zero dependencies

Runs fully offline.

---

## Philosophy
Motivation fades.  
Systems don’t.

This tool exists to remove excuses, not provide comfort.

---

## License
MIT — do whatever you want with it.  
Just don’t lie to yourself.
